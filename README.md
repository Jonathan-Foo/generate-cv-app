# Challenges and Learnings :books:
The generate cv app is my first app built with React. Thus, I learnt an incredible amount during the creation process. I was able learn the React way of developing applications. Websites can be deconstructed into reuseable components, allowing for greater building efficiency. The unidirectoinal flow of data(props) from parent to child components makes data easier to track. The project also allowed me to use JSX for the first time, which was super refreshing.         

### Future Features
- Mobile friendly layout
